Content

The following points describe changes, restrictions and bugs in the corresponding versions:

2025 R2
Cyber security
ETH gateway V2
On change for J1939 DM1
File format options for MDF4, PCAP and PCAPNG
Text operations for formulas
XCP: Support for text signals
Currently used IEV in storage group header
FlexRay null frames
Traffic counter for WiFi and Modem
Time difference check between PC and logger
Limit output place 'IPEcloud2'
'App enabled' column is visible by default
'Task' for formulas
Status signals 'Available memory' and 'Load value'
Free disk space message extented for RAW/MEA
FixedBug:   Requesting a DHCP address from a mobile hotspot that does not support requests of broadcast repliest may take more than one minute.
FixedBug:   PW2050 WiFi module: The module will not respond if it is overloaded due to network congestion, e.g. excessive ARP requests. This will cause the WLAN connection to drop.
FixedBug:   When shutting down IPE833 with a shutdown event and CL-15 connected, the IPE833 supply voltage is not valid

Known restrictions:
IPE853: Bluetooth works with WiFi 5 GHz, with WiFi 2.4 GHz Bluetooth is not supported.
For technical reasons, a mobile access point is forced to change its channel under certain circumstances, which leads to wifi connection drops at client side. The probability of this channel hopping increases significantly if the infrastructure mode (a profile for Wireless LAN exists) and the access point mode are configured on the datalogger/gateway at the same time. If the wifi interface is used for measurement it is recommended to remove all those profiles for Wireless LANs which are used for remote data transfer to servers.
Parallel usage of UDS signals and services for same ECU in parallel
Mobile display works not correct on Win8.1 or later when display scaling is not set to 100% in windows

FixedBug-unverified:   Fixed handling of UInt64 parameter values when a max limit of UInt64.MaxValue was specified in PDX file.
FixedBug-unverified:   COMgate / ublox modem: [CA-90921 / u-blox ID-2 3492] In some mobile networks, when the LTE network deploys SIB24 for 4G-to-5G SA reselection, the module receives scheduling information in SIB1 which contains SIB Type = sibType24-v1530. The current firmware does not handle this newly defined value, which results in dropping the SIB1 message. Consequently, the cell that broadcasts SIB24 is considered as barred, and eventually the module will move to 2G or 3G network and lose 4G services.
FixedBug:   Possible time drift of X devices to other devices in comparison to other signals
